  # NYC Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Data   
This repository contains data on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in New York City. Data are updated daily, which the exception of all tables in the testing and recent data folders which are updated weekly on Thursday. You can view visualizations of these data on the [Health Department’s COVID-19 Data webpage](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page). Additional data related to COVID-19 are available via [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Health&q=covid). 

Data are preliminary and subject to change. Information on this page will change as data and documentation are updated.   

The Health Department classifies the start of the outbreak in NYC as the date of the first laboratory-confirmed case, February 29, 2020.   

## Key notes  
### Report date versus date of event 
Due to lags common with surveillance data, we receive reports of events (diagnoses, hospitalizations and deaths) that happened on past days. We publish trend data (e.g., case-hosp-death.csv) using date of event (date of diagnosis, date of hospitalization or date of death), not date of report.  

Publishing data by date of event better reflects when things actually happened, as opposed to when the Health Department learned about them. We strongly discourage data users from using daily changes to cumulative files as trend data – this is prone to misuse and misinterpretation.  

### Questions and custom requests 
- We will answer questions about the data in this repository as we are able to. If you have any question, please search the [Issues](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/issues?q=) to see if it’s already been addressed.  
- We are not able to accommodate custom data requests placed via Github.   

### Types of Surveillance   
The Health Department conducts two main types of surveillance for COVID-19:    
- Syndromic surveillance   
- Reportable disease surveillance   

#### Syndromic Surveillance   
We receive data from all 53 hospital emergency departments (EDs) in NYC about the types of illnesses people experience on a regular basis. This surveillance allows the Health Department to evaluate care-seeking trends at hospitals for influenza-like illness and pneumonia.    

The information on each patient is evaluated for descriptions that resemble influenza-like illness or pneumonia. Influenza-like illness is defined as mention of either:   
- Fever and cough     
- Fever and sore throat   
- Fever and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 
- Influenza   
  
Pneumonia is defined as mention of or diagnosis of pneumonia. Since the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with these categories that the Health Department tracks routinely, we are able to identify unusual spikes in people seeking care at hospitals. We are using this as a proxy measure to observe COVID-19-like disease in the population.   
*Strengths*:  The data show real-time, population-level trends of people seeking health care for COVID-like disease.   
*Limitations*: The data do not represent patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.   

#### Reportable Disease Surveillance 
The Health Department receives electronic laboratory reports for a number of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, as required by law in the [NYC Health Code](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/providers/reporting-and-services/notifiable-diseases-and-conditions-reporting-central.page). When a specimen is collected from a patient for laboratory testing for the virus that causes COVID-19, the laboratory must report all results, whether positive, negative, or inconclusive, to the Health Department. Demographic information on the person being tested is reported to the Health Department, including name, address, and date of birth.   


There are two categories of COVID-19 tests: 
- *Diagnostic tests*: The primary test for COVID-19 infection is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The PCR test works through direct detection of viral RNA, and typically involves collecting a nasal swab. The [laboratory criteria](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf) for reporting a person with confirmed COVID-19 infection (“case”) are based on the PCR test, and as such, all of the confirmed COVID-19 cases reported out by the Health Department represent people with PCR positive tests. 
- *Antibody tests*: Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies, which can reflect a person’s immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual and population level antibody test results mean for the epidemiology of COVID-19.   
 
*Strengths*: This standard reporting system allows for rapid and detailed information to be transmitted routinely to the Health Department.     
*Limitations*:  
- Because of delays in reporting, the most recent data may be incomplete. Current data will be updated in the future as information on laboratory tests are reported to the Health Department. 

- Health Department recommendations for testing have changed throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. For the first few months of the outbreak, the Health Department previously advised people with mild to moderate symptoms to stay at home and not seek testing to conserve testing supplies and personal protective equipment. Consequently, many cases in the community early in the outbreak were never diagnosed with a laboratory test and  will not be included in these counts.    
- The data include information from patients who reside in congregate facilities, such as correctional facilities and long-term care facilities. While data reported from these facilities may sometimes influence local trends, cases reported from these facilities do not necessarily represent community-based transmission.  
- Information on reported deaths can be limited by delays in reporting by hospitals or funeral homes.    
- These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test may be systematically different from other people in the city; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facility screening. 
- There may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test having a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders) 
- These data are based on electronic laboratory reports, which often lack information on demographic and clinical characteristics of interest, such as race and ethnicity, co-occurring medical conditions, presence and onset date of COVID-19 symptoms, or occupation.

## Technical Notes   

### Case reporting   
NYC COVID-19 data include people who live in NYC or who live in another country but are being treated in NYC. The data do not include people who live outside of NYC but in the United States.   

### Rates vs. Cases   
The Health Department is reporting rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in addition to counts. We report rates to give clear comparisons between different groups — such as borough, sex, or age — with differently sized populations. For example, we may report that the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 100 per 100,000 population in NYC. That means for every 100,000 people living in NYC, there are 100 people diagnosed with COVID-19.   

### Changes to Reported Data   
We update data for earlier dates after we resolve testing and reporting delays. Reported data reflect what we know at the time of the report, not what occurred in real time. For example, we may find that a person who was originally reported to live in NYC no longer does. This person would be removed from our dataset after their address is updated, and our case count would decrease by one.    
  
### Rates per 100,000 People   
Rates for annual citywide-, borough-, ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area)-, and demographic-specific categories were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning.    

Rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for poverty and race/ethnicity groups were calculated using direct standardization for age at diagnosis and weighting by [the US 2000 standard population](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdf).   

### Geography: ZIP codes and ZCTAs  
We report information by geography using modified ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA). It can be challenging to map data that are reported by ZIP Code. A ZIP Code doesn’t actually refer to an area, but rather a collection of points that make up a mail delivery route. Furthermore, there are some buildings that have their own ZIP Code, and some non-residential areas with ZIP Codes.  

To deal with the challenges of ZIP Codes, the Health Department uses ZCTAs which solidify ZIP codes into units of area. Often, data reported by ZIP code are actually mapped by ZCTA. The ZCTA geography was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.  

The Health Department sometimes reports data by modified ZCTA, which combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation.  

### Poverty Groups   
Neighborhood-level poverty groups were classified in a manner consistent with Health Department practices to [describe and monitor disparities in health in NYC](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/epiresearch-SES-measure.pdf). Neighborhood poverty measures are defined as the percentage of people earning below the Federal Poverty Threshold (FPT) within a ZCTA. The standard cut-points for defining categories of neighborhood-level poverty in NYC are:    
- Low: <10% of residents in ZCTA living below the FPT   
- Medium: 10% to <20%   
- High: 20% to <30%    
- Very high: ≥30% residents living below the FPT   
  
### Age Groups  
We are reporting out data for the following age groups: 0-17, 18-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75+. We use these age groups because we found COVID-19 trends to be similar within these groups.   

### Reporting on Hospitalization Status  
The Health Department imports information on hospitalization status from a number of partners, including hospitals, hospital systems, and Regional Health Information Organizations, into our surveillance database. Because data from these partners can be incomplete, the Health Department also estimates the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 who have ever been hospitalized by matching confirmed cases to other sources of hospital admission information. These other sources include:   
- The Health Department’s syndromic surveillance database that tracks daily hospital admissions from all 53 emergency departments across NYC   
- Regional health information organizations 
- NYC public hospitals 
- DOHMH’s electronic death registry system 
- Remote access to electronic health record systems  

Note that hospitalization information can be missing or incomplete from a number of facilities, which is a limitation for any analysis considering hospitalization status by geography (e.g., borough).   

### Reporting on COVID-19 Deaths  
COVID-19 deaths are reported from March 11, 2020 as this was the first date of death for a patient with confirmed COVID-19.   

There are two classifications of COVID-19 deaths reported:   
- A death is classified as **confirmed** if the decedent was an NYC resident who had a positive laboratory test for the virus that causes COVID-19.   
- A death is classified as **probable** if the decedent was an NYC resident (or residency pending) who had no known positive laboratory test for the virus that causes COVID-19 but the death certificate lists “COVID-19” or an equivalent as a cause of death.   
  
As new information becomes available, some deaths previously classified as probable may be reclassified as confirmed.  

Starting in June, 2020, people who died more than 60 days after their COVID-19 diagnosis and who did not have "COVID" or similar listed on their death certificate have been removed from the death count. This is to address instances in which somebody contracted COVID-19 and survived it, but later died.

Differences between death counts between NYC and New York State: Data on deaths reported by NYC are derived from the Health Department’s surveillance database and will be different from data reported by the New York State Department of Health. The State Department of Health reports data on deaths from:   
- The State Hospital Emergency Response Data System   
- Daily calls to hospitals and other facilities that are caring for patients, such as nursing homes   

The NYC Health Department reports data on deaths that reflect both:   
- Positive tests for COVID-19 confirmed by laboratories   
- Confirmations of a person’s death from the City’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and our Bureau of Vital Statistics, which is responsible for the registration, analysis and reporting of all deaths in NYC   
  
### Race and Ethnicity  
Race and ethnicity information is often missing in reportable disease surveillance. Information on race/ethnicity typically comes from electronic laboratory reports and unfortunately, race/ethnicity data is often missing in laboratory reports. For the COVID-19 response, the Health Department has electronically imported aggregated data from partners such as hospitals, hospital systems, or Regional Health Information Organizations to improve the completeness of race/ethnicity data for hospitalized people. However, health records may also be missing the race/ethnicity information. Additionally, the Health Department is working to import race/ethnicity information for people who have died. However, this information is often incomplete or not immediately available because it can take a few days for the information to be entered into the electronic death registration system. Race/ethnicity information is typically collected by funeral directors from next of kin of the decedent. 

Racial health inequities result from a history of structural and institutional racism against people of color. These inequities do not represent personal characteristics of people in these groups. Rather, they represent the effects of long term practices that promote (or fail to end) inequities. Persistent, systemic, and intergenerational systems of oppression manifest in the form of unequal access to basic resources necessary to ensure wellness, including employment, housing, food, green spaces, and health care. In the aggregate, people of color are denied resources that are more often available to white people. The structural inequities that result are further endangering people of color during this pandemic, leading to greater risk of harm to their health.

### case-hosp-death.csv   
This file contains daily counts of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. To address variation in cases diagnosed per day, we have included a rolling 7-day average (mean) of daily case counts. This is calculated as the average of cases diagnosed on that day and the previous 6 days.  This file does not contain information on probable deaths. Counts are aggregated separately by the following dates of interest:  
- Cases are by date of diagnosis   
- Hospitalizations are by date of admission    
- Deaths are by date of death

### tests.csv   
This file contains the number of people who received a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test by day, the number of people with positive results by day, and the percent of all people tested who were positive by day. To address wide variation in single day testing data, the file also includes 7-day averages (means) for the number of people tested and the number of people who were positive.  These are calculated as the average of that day’s count and the previous 6 days.   

Indicators include: 

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe | 
| -------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------:| 
| DATE | Date of specimen collection || 
| TOTAL_TESTS | Number of people who received a PCR test  | Day | 
| POSTITIVE_TESTS | Number of people with positive results| Day | 
| PERCENT_POSITIVE | Percentage of tests that are positive| Day | 
| TOTAL_TESTS_7DAYS_AVG | 7-day average of number of people who received a PCR test| Current day and previous 6 days| 
| POSITIVE_TESTS_7DAYS_AVG | 7-day average of number of people with positive results| Current day and previous 6 days| 
| INCOMPLETE | Used for display purposes only | N/A | 

Note that one person can have more than one test on different days. Therefore, the number of positive persons every day will be different from the epi curves at the top of the webpage as the epi curves will count people only on the first day they test positive.  

Additionally, the metric we are showing here reflects percent positivity by date of specimen collection (when someone went to their doctor for a test). The metric shown on the [milestone webpage](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-goals.page) shows citywide percent positivity by the date that the lab result was reported, which is slightly different. Therefore the two metrics will not be the same for each daily value but show the same patterns.  

### tests-by-zcta.csv   
This file contains the cumulative number of NYC residents who were tested for COVID-19 and the number of people tested who tested positive, by ZCTA of residence.   

The cumulative counts are as of the date of extraction from the NYC Health Department's disease surveillance database.   
 
This file is no longer being updated as of June 9, 2020. For data on testing by modified ZCTA, see data-by-modzcta.csv.

### Geography-resources/ 
This folder contains additional resources for data provided by MODZCTA (modified ZIP code tabulation area) - geographic files for modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area geographies (MODZCTA). For details please visit its [Readme](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/Geography-resources/README.md).

### testing/ 
This folder contains data on antibody tests, which are also referred to as serology tests because they are performed on a blood sample. Reported antibody tests are de-duplicated such that there is one record per person, per week.  

Antibody testing started to become more widely available in NYC in April 2020. Cumulative data include all serology tests reported to the Health Department after March 3, 2020, and data reported by week include tests reported starting on April 5, 2020. 

### testing/antibody-by-week.csv   
This file contains person-level information on antibody tests, by week, as reported to the Health Department by laboratories. 

Antibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. 

Indicators include: 

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe | 
| -------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------:| 
| WEEKDATE| Week-ending date | |     
| NUM_PEOP_TEST | Count of people tested with an antibody test by week  | Cumulative from April 5, 2020 |

| PERCENT_POSITIVE | Percentage of people with a positive result on an antibody test by week | Cumulative from April 5, 2020 |   
| INCOMPLETE | Used for display purposes only | N/A |  

Note that one person can have more than one serology test during different weeks. Therefore, the sum of counts across weeks may not match summary values. People are considered positive if they ever receive a positive antibody result, regardless of whether they have received negative results as well. 

### testing/antibody-by-modzcta.csv   
This file contains person-level information on antibody tests by modified ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA). This unit of geography is similar to ZIP codes but combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size. Please see a description of modified ZCTAs in the technical notes section (Geography: Zip codes and ZCTAs). Modified ZCTAs reflect the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result.  

Indicators include:

Methods for determining neighborhood poverty are outlined in technical notes above (Poverty Groups). The ZCTAs used for classification reflect the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result.  

Indicators include: 

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe | 
| -------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------:| 
| DEMO_VARIABLE| ZCTA-level neighborhood poverty group | |     
| NUM_PEOP_TEST | Count of people tested with an antibody test by neighborhood poverty group  | Cumulative |      
| NUM_PEOP_POS | Count of people with a positive result on an antibody test by neighborhood poverty group | Cumulative |   
| PERCENT_POSITIVE | Percentage of people ever tested for COVID-19 with an antibody test who tested positive by neighborhood poverty group | Cumulative |   
| TEST_RATE | Rate of antibody testing per 100,000 people by neighborhood poverty group | Cumulative | 

The sum of counts may not match summary values because of records with missing geographic information. People in each category are counted once and are considered positive if they ever receive a positive antibody result, regardless of whether they have received negative results as well. 

### testing/antibody-by-sex.csv   
This file contains person-level information on antibody tests, by sex, as reported to the Health Department by laboratories.  

Indicators include: 

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe | 
| -------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------:| 
| DEMO_VARIABLE| Sex | |     
| NUM_PEOP_TEST | Count of people tested with an antibody test by sex  | Cumulative |      
| NUM_PEOP_POS | Count of people with a positive result on an antibody test by sex   | Cumulative |   
| PERCENT_POSITIVE | Percentage of people ever tested for COVID-19 with an antibody test who tested positive by sex   | Cumulative |   
| TEST_RATE | Rate of antibody testing per 100,000 people by sex   | Cumulative | 

The sum of counts may not match summary values because of records with missing demographic information. People in each category are counted once and are considered positive if they ever receive a positive antibody result, regardless of whether they have received negative results as well.

### recent/ 
This folder contains data from the most recent 4-week period, with a one-week lag. We update these files on Thursdays, with data through the previous Saturday. 

### recent/recent-4-week-citywide.csv  
This file contains counts of confirmed cases and deaths. This file does not contain information on probable deaths. Counts are aggregated separately by week and the following dates of interest:  
- Cases are by date of diagnosis   
- Deaths are by date of death   

Confirmed cases and deaths are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. Because of delays in reporting, all data are lagged to include the most recent complete week (week 1), and the three prior most recent weeks. For example, in the weekly update that occurred on Thursday, July 23, weeks 1-4 represent the following dates of interest:   
- Week 1: July 13-18 
- Week 2: July 5-12 
- Week 3: June 28 – July 4 
- Week 4: June 21-27 

Indicators include: 

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe | 
| -------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------:| 
| Most recent (week 1) | Summary count of confirmed cases and  confirmed deaths| Most recent complete week |    
| WEEK 2 | Summary count of confirmed cases and  confirmed deaths | Week 2 |    
| WEEK 3 | Summary count of confirmed cases and  confirmed deaths | Week 3 |    
| WEEK 3 | Summary count of confirmed cases and  confirmed deaths | Week 4 |    


### recent/recent-4-week-by-modzcta.csv    
This file contains data by modified ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA). This unit of geography is similar to ZIP codes but combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation.  Please see description of modified ZCTAs in the technical notes section (Geography: Zip codes and ZCTAs).   

This file contains indicators over the most recent 4 weeks (with a 1-week lag to account for reporting delays) that are aggregated by modified ZCTA and the following dates of interest:   
- Cases are by date of diagnosis   
- Deaths are by date of death   

Confirmed cases and deaths are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday. Because of delays in reporting, all data are lagged to include the most recent complete week (week 1), and the four prior most recent weeks. For example, in the weekly update that occurred on Thursday, July 23, weeks 1-4 represent the following dates of interest:   
- Week 1: July 13-18 
- Week 2: July 5-12 
- Week 3: June 28 – July 4 
- Week 4: June 21-27
